##  Overview
This project involves a structured analysis of Netflix's Movies and TV Shows data using SQL. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights and solve business-centric queries using raw content metadata. The SQL script answers 15 different analytical questions related to content types, genre trends, countries of origin, key contributors, and viewer-targeted characteristics. The project demonstrates strong command over string functions, date filtering, and aggregation logic.

##Objectives

Identify the most frequent ratings across both content types

List and explore content by release year, country, and duration

Determine trends in director and actor participation

Categorize content using keywords in descriptions (e.g., violence, kill)

Highlight high-content producing countries and popular genres

Extract content insights based on addition timelines and duration logic

Apply filtering techniques to isolate niche content like documentaries
