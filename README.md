![Netflix_logo](https://github.com/jahanvioberoi/Netlix_sql_project/blob/main/Netflix%20logo.png)

##  üìù OVERVIEW
This project involves a structured analysis of Netflix's Movies and TV Shows data using SQL. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights and solve business-centric queries using raw content metadata. The SQL script answers 15 different analytical questions related to content types, genre trends, countries of origin, key contributors, and viewer-targeted characteristics. The project demonstrates strong command over string functions, date filtering, and aggregation logic.

## üéØOBJECTIVES

Analyze the distribution of content types: Movies vs. TV Shows

Identify the most frequent ratings across both content types

List and explore content by release year, country, and duration

Determine trends in director and actor participation

Categorize content using keywords in descriptions (e.g., violence, kill)

Highlight high-content producing countries and popular genres

Extract content insights based on addition timelines and duration logic

Apply filtering techniques to isolate niche content like documentaries

## üìÇ DATASET
The data for this project is sourced from the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset available on Kaggle.

üîó Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download

The dataset includes details like title, cast, country, rating, and date when the content was added to the platform.

## üìå Findings & Conclusion
## Content Distribution
Movies dominate the platform, but there is a significant and growing number of TV Shows.
The overall distribution suggests Netflix prioritizes variety in format and content type.

## Common Ratings
TV-MA (Mature Audience) and TV-14 are among the most frequent ratings.
Indicates Netflix focuses largely on mature and young adult audiences rather than kids.

 ## Release Year Trends
A large proportion of content was released after 2010, with peaks around 2018‚Äì2020.
This reflects Netflix‚Äôs shift toward original programming and recent acquisitions.

## Geographical Insights
The United States, India, and the United Kingdom are the top countries contributing to Netflix‚Äôs library.
India consistently contributes a sizable portion of content annually.
Regional diversity has increased in recent years with entries from Korea, Canada, and Australia.

## Longest Duration
Identifying the longest movie revealed how outliers can be used for marketing or niche content targeting.

## Content Categorization (Good vs. Bad)
Keyword-based classification using terms like ‚Äúkill‚Äù or ‚Äúviolence‚Äù helps in content tagging and moderation.
Majority of content is ‚ÄúGood‚Äù by this metric, but this logic can be extended for sentiment or genre-specific filters.

## Genre Preferences

Documentaries, Dramas, and Comedies dominate across both content types.
These genres show higher versatility across both Movies and TV Shows.

## Actor/Director Patterns
Some actors (e.g., Salman Khan) appear repeatedly in Indian content over the last 10 years.
Directors like Rajiv Chilaka have a strong presence in kids/animated shows, revealing niche specialization.

## TV Show Duration Insights
Multiple TV shows have more than 5 seasons, indicating long-term viewer engagement.
This can signal shows with cult followings or high renewal rates.

## Recent Additions (Last 5 Years)
A surge in content additions between 2018‚Äì2021 reflects Netflix's expansion strategy.
Post-pandemic, the platform continued to invest in both local and global content acquisitions.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This SQL-based analysis of Netflix‚Äôs content library gives a structured, data-driven look into:

## 1) Viewer preferences (genre, rating)
## 2) Content strategy (regional focus, duration trends)
## 3) Data-driven categorization (keywords and sentiment cues)
## 4) Potential indicators for content planning, localization, and audience targeting

This project can help media strategists, data teams, and content creators understand market trends and design viewer-centric offerings more effectively.
